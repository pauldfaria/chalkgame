I merged the jump command into my modifications, and removed all of the 
old stuff. Now reading the code should be much easier, but it's still 
not perfect. Most noticeable changes: everything runs together, there 
are instructions and (bad) credits. Player class modified to be able to 
include npc, human class added to represent human controlled players. 
Magic shield now takes 45 mana to use. basic changed to level1 and flow 
between main menu and level1 improved.
